# CUDA.Undersoft.Boost.Research
Research version of the algorithm accelerating pattern finding in problems with complexity equal to the permutation (Boost.Permutation). Like finding the shortest path between points by brute-force with optimization. It addresses the problem of graphs and the traveling salesman.
